## Tools

I will be using these platforms for designing: 

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/): an image editor for most of the visual design, including digital drawing.

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/): a professional open source painting program

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): a design tool for presentations and social media. I will be using canva for the text design.
