### Title 
Cut vs. fire: comparing temporal effects of disturbances on ecological indicators



### Introduction 
Large-scale natural disturbances, such as timber harvest and wildfire, are influencing stand structure and linked to declines of boreal species, including woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). To understand post-disturbance successional patterns, we compared the recovery trajectory of timber, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat indicators across boreal forest stands in Alberta, Canada. 



### Method 
We measured stand attributes (e.g., basal area, stems per hectare), coarse woody debris, and abundance of forage for wildlife in:

- Timber harvested stands (251, 0-40 year since disturbance)
- Burned stands (264, 0-40 year since disturbance)
- Caribou stands (256, > 40 year since disturbance)



### Results
#### Timber indicator
- Basal area, stems per hectare, and quadratic mean 
diameter recovered quicker in harvest sites than wildfire sites.  

- With greater time since disturbance, there were no differences in timber indicators among harvest, wildfire, and caribou use sites.  

- Basal area of deciduous trees was generally greater in harvest sites compared to wildfire and caribou use sites. 

#### Biodiversity indicator
- Coarse woody debris was greatest in young wildfire sites, but declined over time to not differ from wildfire and caribou use sites.  

#### Wildlife habitat indicator
- Caribou forage lichens were most abundant in older caribou use sites

- Forage for moose and bears, including shrubs, was most abundant in younger timber harvest and wildfire sites.



### Conclusion
Timber harvesting may result in a quicker development of timber volume when compared to wildfire. However, this anthropogenic disturbance is less advantageous for the development of caribou habitat.
